## Portfolio Project 2 Frontend Development Website

![Responsiveness](md_images/responsive.png)

This Website is a fully interective and responsive "online studies" resource intended for those looking to test their knowledge in the desired study subject. 
The user will find a simple UX orientated web application incorporating a "flash card" game/quiz, and allowing the user to select which category they would like to be tested on. 

This project is intended for educational purposes only, and not intended for business/professional use. 
The project is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to achieve the main goal of making the web application understable and interactive for first-time readers.

## Structure of the website

The website is designed to be easy and user-friendy on all type of devices. On desktop, tablet or mobile device there should be no difference for a user to have a fantastic experience. All parts are designed to achieve maximum user satisfaction. The user will get some interaction from the interface as links and buttons will have a hover effects.

Quizology provides users with value by presenting a platform where they can nurture their education, specifically within 4 core subjects maths, history, science and geography.

The quizzes provided, allow the user a unique, interactive and entertaining approach to developing the target user's understanding in the 4 listed categories of study.The quizzes listed above are made with simplicity and efficiency in mind, replicating the effect of "flash cards", meaning that when the user begins the quiz, the application will pick random questions from the handful of specific questions for the user to be tested on. This will allow the users to learn through repition, memorising key points of study for each subject.Through the use of the score section within the game area, the user will be able to take note of how well they're doing and what questions they must improve on.Each question will provide the user with an alert telling them wether their answer is correct, and compare their answer to the correct answer, meaning that the user will be able to improve on their faults and understand their strong-points in the subject quizzes.The website is made for anyone to try as long as they share an interest in testing their knowledge, wether they are new and looking for an informative and interesting appooach to their studies, or a returning user, looking to improve in their studies.
