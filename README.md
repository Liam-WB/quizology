## Structure of the website

The website is designed to be easy and user-friendy on all type of devices. On desktop, tablet or mobile device there should be no difference for a user to have a fantastic experience. All parts are designed to achieve maximum user satisfaction. The user will get some interaction from the interface as links and buttons will have a hover effects.

Quizology provides users with value by presenting a platform where they can nurture their education, specifically within 4 core subjects maths, history, science and geography.

The quizzes provided, allow the user a unique, interactive and entertaining approach to developing the target user's understanding in the 4 listed categories of study.The quizzes listed above are made with simplicity and efficiency in mind, replicating the effect of "flash cards", meaning that when the user begins the quiz, the application will pick random questions from the handful of specific questions for the user to be tested on. This will allow the users to learn through repition, memorising key points of study for each subject.Through the use of the score section within the game area, the user will be able to take note of how well they're doing and what questions they must improve on.Each question will provide the user with an alert telling them wether their answer is correct, and compare their answer to the correct answer, meaning that the user will be able to improve on their faults and understand their strong-points in the subject quizzes.The website is made for anyone to try as long as they share an interest in testing their knowledge, wether they are new and looking for an informative and interesting appooach to their studies, or a returning user, looking to improve in their studies.

# Features

### Page structures

The website consists of 5 pages, all accessible from the navigation menu. On the homepage, you can also access the category pages via the icon links.
Page alerts are also implemented depending on interaction from the user. Alerts include correct and incorrect answer messages, as well as unkown data type messages.

The website contains the features listed below:

## Navigation bar

- #### Navigation bar is visible on the top of each website. It is compact and responsive, and will adapt to mobile devices via a change into a burger menu. It also contains a dropdown feature to group and access the categories in one location rather than spread throughout the nav bar.

* Navigation scheme:

  - On left side there is a logo. It can be used as a navigation link to the main page.
  - On right side there are 2 buttons. It contains:
    - Home
    - Categories (Dropdown menu)
      - Maths
      - History
      - Science
      - Geography

  - The buttons also contain a hover effect for visibility, so the user is able to tell which button they will be selecting when clicking on it.

![Header](md_images/header.png)

## Home

- ### Landing Page

  - The landing page contains a welcome message to greet new and returning users and guide them to the category selection section in the center of the page.

    ![Landing Page](md_images/LP.png)

- ### Category Link Icons

  - The icons located in the center of the landing page are images wrapped in an anchor link to each of the 4 categories. They are large and contrast against the main color pallet to easily lead the user to the categories. The formation of these icons will switch to horizontal when the viewport size reaches the small-medium media query range.

    ![Icons](md_images/Icons.png)

## Maths, History, Science and Geography Pages

- ### Game Area Section

  - Container for the individual quiz features. All of the JS scripts are focused into the game area, to make the project more organised and easier to navigate the code. The game is changed depending on the category selected and all the variables within the game area change accordingly.

![Game Area](md_images/GA.png)

- ### Category Title

  - Large, bold text at the top center of the game area, to indicate which section of the web application the user is on.

![Category Title](md_images/CT.png)

  - This section contains 2 sub-sections: The Right and Wrong sections - These will count and display the number of their respective answers within each category. This section will switch to a more compact version when the viewport reaches a small-medium screen size range.

![Score Area](md_images/TA.png)

- ### Submit Button

  - This button calls the alert functions when interacted with by the user. It contains a fade in/out effect for a unique addition to the project.

![Submit Button](md_images/Submit.png)

- ### Alerts

  - The alerts will display when the submit button is interacted with, after an answer has been input. The alert displayed can be "correct" or "incorrect" followed by the correct answer for comparison.

![Alerts](md_images/Alert.png)

# Testing

- I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project to extensively test and debug any structure/style issues, as well as [https://validatejavascript.com/] for the JS validation.

## Compatibility Tests

- This website was rigorously tested on various browswers and devices including google chrome, microsoft edge and safari, all of which were tested on IOS devices (An Iphone and Ipad) and windows devices (ASUS laptop and windows OS desktop PC).

## Lighthouse Tests

- I used chrome dev tools' lighthouse to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

![Home Lighthouse](md_images/LH-Maths.png)

history.html, science.html, geography.html (as the content is similar)
![Home Lighthouse](md_images/LH-History.png)

## Code Validation

- I used [jshint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JS.
- I used [W3C HTML Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my HTML.
- I used [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS.

## Issues/bugs found during testing/development

The following lists some issues encountered during the development of the website. Some issues were fixed, some would have been fixed with more time/future impelementations.

- Encountered an issue where certain icons were'nt appearing as intended.
- This was only on certain icons, where I would recieve error messages such as "ERROR GET favicon " so I kept away from icons that were giving these error messages as I assumed they were not formatted properly.

- Encountered an error when validating HTML with error message "End tag for body seen, but there were unclosed elements.", however the labelled line includes closing tags.

- Encountered an issue where the final question in the list of available questions for the history, science and geography pages were not displaying.

- Encountered an issue where questions would display multiple times in a row.

Past bugs and changes can be found in the [Commit Page](https://github.com/Liam-WB/hackney-coffee/commit/main).

## User Story Tests

### As a business owner:

- I want to create a positive user experience, fully responsive, interactive and fully functional web application resulting in a beneficial end-result.

### As a first time user:

- I want an engaging experience that gratifies the main purpose of my visit, in this case being to test my knowledge in the given subject of study and show me what I know and don't know. I also want a simple and positive user experience.

### As a client:

- I want to be able to access this web application flexibly, remotely and from any browser or device.

### As a returning user:

- I want to be able to come back to the website and compare my scores to the last time I visited and try different subject quizzes.
